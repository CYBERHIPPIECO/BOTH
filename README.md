# BOTH - VR GAME
“If you never ask the question, the answer can still be yes”

Estimate the amount necessary to support yourself and make the game
Kickstarter-style
Write the monologues
Highly-detailed 3D scenes the player watches and can interact with. Showing scenes from player’s life (every time it’s a different situation/question of yes or no)

Logo appears.

Press A to Continue:

Main Menu appears with BEGIN and BELAY.

When we press BEGIN we zoom into the 3D room. We are suddenly aware of the spatiality of the geometric patterns.
A voice: “WELCOME, EXPERIMENT WILL BEGIN SOON, PLEASE STAY MOTIONLESS”

You are being lowered into a box-shape, if you start slightly moving your point of view around voice reminds you: “PLEASE REMAIN MOTIONLESS”. If you do it a couple of times “I SAID MOTIONLESS”. “STOP IT!”.

If you start moving vigorously you dislodge from the suspender and you fall onto the floor.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_suicide_and_immortality

In quantum mechanics, quantum suicide is a thought experiment, originally published independently by Hans Moravec in 1987[1][2] and Bruno Marchal in 1988,[3][4] and independently developed further by Max Tegmark in 1998.[5] It attempts to distinguish between the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics and the Everett many-worlds interpretation by means of a variation of the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment, from the cat's point of view. Quantum immortality refers to the subjective experience of surviving quantum suicide regardless of the odds.[6]

Keith Lynch recalls that Hugh Everett took great delight in paradoxes such as the unexpected hanging. Everett did not mention quantum suicide or quantum immortality in writing, but his work was intended as a solution to the paradoxes of quantum mechanics. Lynch said "Everett firmly believed that his many-worlds theory guaranteed him immortality: His consciousness, he argued, is bound at each branching to follow whatever path does not lead to death",[7] Tegmark explains, however, that life and death situations do not normally hinge upon a sequence of binary quantum events like those in the thought experiment.[6]

Quantum suicide thought experiment

Unlike the Schrödinger's cat thought experiment which used poison gas and a radioactive decay trigger, this version involves a life-terminating device and a device that measures the spin value of protons. Every 10 seconds, the spin value of a fresh proton is measured. Conditioned upon that quantum bit, the weapon is either deployed, killing the experimenter, or it makes an audible "click" and the experimenter survives.
The theories are distinctive from the point of view of the experimenter only; their predictions are otherwise identical.

The probability of surviving the first iteration of the experiment is 50%, under both interpretations, as given by the squared norm of the wave function. At the start of the second iteration, if theCopenhagen interpretation is true, the wave function has already collapsed, so if the experimenter is already dead, there's a 0% chance of survival. However, if the many-worlds interpretation is true, a superposition of the live experimenter necessarily exists, regardless of how many iterations or how improbable the outcome. Barring life after death, it is not possible for the experimenter to experience having been killed, thus the only possible experience is one of having survived every iteration. 

He claims that he is everywhere and nowhere at the same time, which is similar to the cat being alive and dead at the same time.[3] It is also said that he can only exist as long as he is aware of himself.

random chance, rather than any single person, is responsible for his eventual death.

if you never ask the question, the answer can still be yes.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_realism

Modal realism is the view propounded by David Kellogg Lewis that all possible worlds are as real as the actual world. It is based on the following tenets: possible worlds exist; possible worlds are not different in kind from the actual world; possible worlds are irreducible entities; the term actual in actual world is indexical, i.e. any subject can declare their world to be the actual one, much as they label the place they are "here" and the time they are "now”.

At the heart of David Lewis's modal realism are six central doctrines about possible worlds:
Possible worlds exist – they are just as real as our world;
Possible worlds are the same sort of things as our world – they differ in content, not in kind;
Possible worlds cannot be reduced to something more basic – they are irreducible entities in their own right.
Actuality is indexical. When we distinguish our world from other possible worlds by claiming that it alone is actual, we mean only that it is our world.
Possible worlds are unified by the spatiotemporal interrelations of their parts; every world is spatiotemporally isolated from every other world.
Possible worlds are causally isolated from each other.
By what right do we call possible worlds and their inhabitants disreputable entities, unfit for philosophical services unless they can beg redemption from philosophy of language? I know of no accusation against possibles that cannot be made with equal justice against sets. Yet few philosophical consciences scruple at set theory. Sets and possibles alike make for a crowded ontology. Sets and possibles alike raise questions we have no way to answer. [...] I propose to be equally undisturbed by these equally mysterious mysteries.[1]


How many [possible worlds] are there? In what respects do they vary, and what is common to them all? Do they obey a nontrivial law of identity of indiscernibles? Here I am at a disadvantage compared to someone who pretends as a figure of speech to believe in possible worlds, but really does not. If worlds were creatures of my imagination, I could imagine them to be any way I liked, and I could tell you all you wished to hear simply by carrying on my imaginative creation. But as I believe that there really are other worlds, I am entitled to confess that there is much about them that I do not know, and that I do not know how to find out.[2]

Criticism
Saul Kripke described modal realism as "totally misguided', "wrong", and "objectionable".[6] Kripke argued that possible worlds were not like distant countries out there to be discovered; rather, we stipulate what is true according to them. Kripke also criticized modal realism for its reliance on counterpart theory, which he regarded as untenable, which should surprise nobody as counterpart theory is a rival to Kripke's own possible-worlds semantics.

Robert Stalnaker, while he finds some merit in Lewis's account of possible worlds finds the position to be ultimately untenable. He himself advances a more "moderate" realism about possible worlds, which he terms modal actualism (since it holds that all that exists is in fact actual, and that there are no "merely possible" entities."[4] In particular, Stalnaker does not accept Lewis's attempt to argue on the basis of a supposed analogy with the epistemological objection to mathematical Platonism that believing in possible worlds as he (Lewis) imagines them is no less reasonable than believing in mathematical entities such as sets or functions.[5]


"Quantum flapdoodle"[edit]

"Quantum flapdoodle" is a term reportedly coined by Murray Gell-Mann to describe "stringing together a series of terms and phrases from quantum physics and asserting that they explain something in our daily experience". The term has been used by skeptics to describe quantum mysticism as espoused by people such as Deepak Chopra.[19]
